# Movie Review API (Phase 1)

This is the Phase 1 foundation of the Movie Review API built with Django + DRF.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (already configured if using this workspace):
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set values.

## Run

- Make migrations and run the dev server after Phase 1 setup:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Docs at `/api/docs/` after server starts.
