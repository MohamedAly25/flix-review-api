## 1. Project Overview

As a backend developer, your task is to design and implement a Movie Review API using Django and Django REST Framework. This API will allow users to manage reviews for movies by adding, updating, deleting, and viewing reviews. You will be responsible for building a fully functional API that interacts with a database to store user-generated reviews, mimicking a real-world development environment. This project will challenge your skills in database management, API design, and authentication, and you will be required to deploy your API to a live environment.

**Project Scope**: Individual Development (MVP Focus)  
**Target Audience**: Backend developers and API consumers  
**Primary Goal**: Create a functional movie review API with proper authentication and CRUD operations

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Review Management (CRUD)
- **Create**: Implement the ability to create new reviews
- **Read**: Implement the ability to read reviews (all, by ID, by movie)
- **Update**: Implement the ability to update existing reviews
- **Delete**: Implement the ability to delete existing reviews
- Each review should include: Movie Title, Review Content, Rating (out of 5), User ID, and Created Date
- Validation for required fields: Rating (1 to 5), Movie Title, and Review Content
- Only authenticated users can perform CRUD operations on reviews

### 2.2 Users Management (CRUD)
- **Create**: Implement user registration
- **Read**: Implement user profile viewing
- **Update**: Implement user profile updating
- **Delete**: Implement user account deletion
- Each user should have: Unique Username, Email, and Password
- Only authenticated users should be able to submit, update, or delete their own reviews
- Implement permission checks to ensure users cannot modify or delete reviews submitted by other users

### 2.3 View Reviews by Movie
- Create an endpoint to allow users to view reviews for a specific movie
- The endpoint should filter reviews based on Movie Title
- Include pagination for results, especially if a movie has many reviews
- Include sorting options for reviews

### 2.4 Review Search and Filtering
- Allow users to search for reviews by Movie Title
- Allow users to filter reviews by Rating
- Add optional filter to view reviews with specific ratings (e.g., show only 4-star and 5-star reviews)
- Support multiple filter combinations

---

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Database
- Use Django ORM to interact with the database
- Define models for Reviews and Users
- Ensure that the Movie Title field allows for multiple reviews for the same movie from different users
- Implement proper database indexing for performance

### 3.2 Authentication
- Implement user authentication using Django's built-in authentication system
- Users should be required to log in before adding, updating, or deleting reviews
- Implement token-based authentication (JWT) for a more secure API experience
- Ensure proper session management and token security

### 3.3 API Design
- Use Django Rest Framework (DRF) to design and expose the API endpoints
- Adhere to RESTful principles by using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Ensure proper error handling with relevant HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for invalid input, 404 for not found)
- Implement proper serialization and deserialization

### 3.4 Deployment
- Deploy the API on Heroku or PythonAnywhere
- Ensure the API is accessible, stable, and secure in the deployed environment
- Configure environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement health checks and monitoring

### 3.5 Pagination and Sorting
- Add pagination to the review listing and search endpoints for better performance when handling large datasets
- Provide sorting options, such as sorting reviews by Rating or Date Created
- Support custom pagination parameters (limit, offset)

## 5. Error Handling Strategy

### 5.1 HTTP Status Codes
- **200 OK**: Request successful
- **201 Created**: Resource created successfully
- **204 No Content**: Request successful, no content to return
- **400 Bad Request**: Validation error or invalid input
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limit exceeded
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server error

### 5.2 Standardized Error Response Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message description",
  "errors": {
    "field_name": ["error details"]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 5.3 Success Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Success message description",
  "data": {},
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```
