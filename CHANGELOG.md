## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading to 1.0.0

No breaking changes from 0.7.0. Simply pull latest code:

```bash
git pull origin main
pip install -r requirements/production.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### Upgrading to 0.5.0 (Genre Normalization)

**⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE**: Movie `genre` field changed from CharField to ManyToMany.

Migration steps:
1. Backup your database
2. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate movies`
3. Old genre data is automatically migrated
4. Update API calls to use genre objects instead of strings

Before:
```json
{
  "genre": "Action"
}
```

After:
```json
{
  "genres": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Action", "slug": "action"}
  ]
}
```
